            <p> I was originally born in Columbia South Carolina. When my parents got divorced, my mom, brother, and I
                moved in with my grandparents in southern New Hampshire. I spent the majority of my life shoveling snow,
                hiking mountains, and falling in love with the way the leaves changed colors in the fall. Throughout my
                high school years, I experimented with different artistic styles like painting, pottery, drawing, and
                later, photography. I became captivated by film photography and dedicated my last 2 years of high school
                to nothing but the arts. Towards the end of high school, I found myself seeing photography as more of a
                hobby instead of a job. Scratching all my college plans, I graduated high school without any idea of
                longterm work and found myself working full-time. </p>
            <p>When the opportunity emerged to move to Florida, I didn’t miss a beat packing my bags. Once settled in, I
                begin to expand my comfort zone and started self-teaching myself the fundamentals of reading and writing
                code. I wanted to grow my knowledge further and thus, applied for UCF’s Coding BootCamp.
